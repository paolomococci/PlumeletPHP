# tier one `plumeletphp_db`

## create database `plumeletphp_db`

```sql
-- The statement removes the database named `plumeletphp_db` if it is already present.
-- This is useful when you want to start fresh without any residual data.
-- `IF EXISTS` prevents an error from being raised if the database does not exist.
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS plumeletphp_db;
-- Create Database (if it does not exist).
-- `IF NOT EXISTS` ensures that the command is a no-op if the database is already there.
-- `DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4` sets the default character encoding to UTF-8 with support for 4-byte characters (useful for emojis, certain Asian scripts, etc.).
-- `DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci` specifies the default collation, which is case-insensitive (`ci`) and uses the general Unicode ordering.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS plumeletphp_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
-- Switch to the Newly Created Database
-- This means that any tables, indexes, or other objects created afterwards will belong to this database.
USE plumeletphp_db;
-- `SHOW WARNINGS` outputs any warning messages generated by the previous statements.
-- If the output is empty, it indicates that no warnings were produced during the execution of the script.
SHOW WARNINGS;
